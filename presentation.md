‚Ä¢ lock picking is only possible because of manufacturing errors
‚Ä¢ a perfect lock is unpickable
‚Ä¢ if you apply tension, the plug will catch on the pin furthest away from the centerline

# wafer locks

---

![fit left](wafer-locked.png)
![fit right](wafer-with-key.png)

^ 
‚Ä¢ similar to tumbler locks
‚Ä¢ lower standards for tolerances
‚Ä¢ easier to pick
‚Ä¢ wafers are one piece
‚Ä¢ wafers move up and down 
‚Ä¢ cannot be bumped

---

# try-out keys

![](try-out-keys.jpg)

^
‚Ä¢ insert & sorta jiggle them around
‚Ä¢ possible due to low tolerances
‚Ä¢ example: set of 64 try-out keys opens almost all General Motors cars before 1967
‚Ä¢ only need to be close enough

# tubular locks

‚Ä¢ similar to tumbler locks
‚Ä¢ can be single pin picked
‚Ä¢ access is more difficult
‚Ä¢ especially tension
‚Ä¢ cannot be bumped

---

‚Ä¢ awesome tools like this
‚Ä¢ adjustable pins
‚Ä¢ get them all right
‚Ä¢ you'll have a key

# magnetic keyed locks

![](magnetic-lock.jpg)

^
‚Ä¢ absolutely insane
‚Ä¢ works like a tumbler lock
‚Ä¢ no physical access to pins
‚Ä¢ pins are pushed into place by a strip with varying magnetic force

---

![mute loop autoplay](magnetic-lock.mp4)

^
‚Ä¢ absolutely insane
‚Ä¢ picking with a magnet
‚Ä¢ this lock is 20+ years old
‚Ä¢ some locks remain unpicked
